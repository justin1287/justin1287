Hello, Iâ€™m Justin
 
I recently graduated from the University of Virginia with a Master's Degree in Statistics in May 2022. I also attended UVA for my undergraduate degree,
where I double majored in statistics and economics. I have experience coding in R, Python, and SAS.
 
I am seeking a progessional postion in either quantitative analytics or data science. Please feel free to explore my repositories to learn more about 
recent projects I have completed in my free time or throughout my schooling.
